# Template for Dialogue Systems Final Project Report

### Overview
For the final project submission, you will be expected to submit both a report and the code associated with your project. Below are details on getting setup for both.

#### Templates
* [LaTeX template](https://naacl2019.org/downloads/naaclhlt2019-latex.zip)
* [Overleaf LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-naacl-hlt-2019-proceedings/xyyfwfkswhth) __Note:__ You must uncomment the `\aclfinalcopy` line so that it formats correctly.
* [Word template](https://naacl2019.org/downloads/naaclhlt2019-word.zip)
(using [ACL 2018](https://acl2018.org/downloads/acl18-word.zip) because it
NAACL 2019 only has anonymized version of Word).

#### Software Requirements
For writing your report on your local machine, you must install a version of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) or [Microsoft Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/word). Overleaf is cloud-based so a local installation of LaTeX is not necessary.

#### Local LaTeX Setup (not Overleaf)
* [Possible Mac setup with Atom](http://economistry.com/2016/02/create-first-pdf-latex-atom-mac/)
* [Possible Windows setup with Notepad++](http://johnbruer.com/2013/05/21/latex-editing-using-notepad/)

#### Writing Advice
* While the general organization of the final project report is up to you (as long as it follows the [Final Project Description](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/61204/pages/final-project-description) by including an Introduction, Related Work, Approach, Evaluation, and Conclusions), one recommended format is from Svetlana Stoyanchev's class [here](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sstoyanchev/SDS2015/#project) (under `6. Final Report`).
* For thinking about organization of demonstration papers (if you are thinking about submitting an eventual version of your work to a conference demonstration track), you can browse the SIGdial Demo Proceedings (e.g., [Lee et al.](https://www.sigdial.org/files/workshops/conference19/proceedings/pdf/SIGdial28.pdf) or [Papangelis et al.](https://www.sigdial.org/files/workshops/conference19/proceedings/pdf/SIGdial25.pdf)) or the [ACL Demo Proceedings](https://aclanthology.info/volumes/proceedings-of-acl-2018-system-demonstrations) (e.g., [Lukin et al.](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-4016) or [Burstev et al.](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-4021)).

#### Software Repository Setup
* Add or [transfer](https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-personal-account/) your repository to this organization.
* [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) `report-template` for your own paper, or copy its contents into a folder like `report` in your repository.
* Make a `README.md` for your project using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

#### Git Large File System (LFS)
* For large binary files (over 100MB), you may need to commit them with [Git LFS](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-large-file-storage/). There may be restrictions on file size that GitHub supports.
